random wallpapers from image.google.com
and make a slideshow of the wallpapers
found in the current folder."

Install, NO install, it just a bash script!, but ...
Keep in mind, run it as normal user, always!

If you want your own photos, wallpapers to be used, first, if you like, 
erase any *.jpg in the folder where the script is located, then go 
ahead and copy your family photos or whatever into, then you need 
to run ./borednomore with -d 0 (in borednomore2.0.02b) flag, and 
similar if you using the older version of the script, you may use 
the -h flag and see all the available options.

to run it, you: 
tar xvf borednomore2.tar.gz
cd borednomore2
chmod +x borednomore2

Execute!
./borednomore2
